# [Waggy Box](https://waggy-box.herokuapp.com/)

</div>
Waggy Box (fictional) is a dog treat and toy subscription box for pet owners in Ireland. Finding durable toys and tasty treats has been the most difficult task I've encountered as a pet owner.  So, the idea of Waggy Box was created, to allieviate this difficulty.  All toys are tried and tested by my own three dogs, and only the toys approved by these guys will be featured in the monthly box.

## **Design** 

Waggy Box was designed with ease and playfulness in mind. Making use of bright colours and two sans-serif fonts with varying weights to ensure accurate emphasis is given to the secions. 

This project was aimed at dog owners and dog lovers, who regularly struggle to find great toys and treats tasty enough to train and play with their furry friends. 

Waggy-Box' site is split into two parts :

**Free Tier:**

Users are initially registered on the free tier page.  They have a limited view of what the site offers, in terms of being able to navigate to the subscription page and to contact the site owners. 

**Paid Tier:**

The paid tier users have full access to the website.  They can review items in next month's box, shop items from the previous month, contact the site owner and adjust their own subscription plan. 


#### **Colour Scheme**

#### **Typography**
 
 - **Montserrat:**
    - The primary font across the webiste, using four different weights: 200, 300, 400, 500
    - Montserrat is a clean font used regularly, so it is both an attractive and appropriate choice to be the primary font across the site.

- **Rubik**
    - Rubik was used for the main page headings, of a weight 500 for the page headings and 300 for the sub-heading sections.
    - Rubik added the element of playfulness to the application, without making it appear childish.
